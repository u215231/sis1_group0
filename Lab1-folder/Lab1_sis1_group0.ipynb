By the end of the course, each group should be able to synthesize the sound produced by a plucked string instrument using the knowledge acquired in the theory and seminar classes. This will be a cumulative process, in each lab new techniques will be applied in order to improve the synthesis. First let's show what we will achieve by the end of the course.
